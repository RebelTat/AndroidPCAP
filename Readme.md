**Android Pcap Capture**

Android tool for capturing packets with a RTL8187 device nic connected with a USB-OTG cable.

This is a fork of the original project with the added feature of capturing the signal strength. The actual value of the stored signal strenght is wrong, but the relation between values should be somewhat correct so this allows one to differentiate which devices were closer/further away.

Original project is here https://www.kismetwireless.net/android-pcap/, the hard work was done by Jinghao Shi as described here, http://jhshi.me/2014/09/21/get-packet-signal-strength-of-rtl8187-dongle/.
